SUGGESTED BY USERS:
* "One thing I have some concerns about is that if you hover over a quote its sources pop up and lengthen the page and makes it hard to press the 'load more' option, maybe an "on click" expansion would work well, otherwise the sources are really well laid out. "
* random quote by category
* shuffle on refresh
* REST API
* Option to AND instead of OR tags  and search query
* Maybe these fields shouldn't be mandatory, because I received stuff like: "new_credit":"I did not find it on a fan creation, but I cannot submit without filling this field"}, "contact_email":"nope@nope.net",
* Get quotes from: https://www.dropbox.com/s/kff4q52czd3nfv2/Mehcanicus%20Quotes.docx?dl=0


MEDIUM:

LOW:
